<div>The specified values of all my properties default to their
    initial values, because none of them are given in the CSS.</div>

<div class="fun">
  <p>The specified value of my font family is not given explicitly
      in the CSS, so it is inherited from my parent. However,
      the border is not an inheriting property.</p>
</div>
