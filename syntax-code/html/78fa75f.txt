<p>
  If the <code>env()</code> function is supported in your browser, 
  this paragraph’s text will have 50px of padding between it and
  the left border — but not the top, right and bottom.
  This is because the accompanying CSS is the equivalent of
  <code>padding: 0 0 0 50px</code>, because, unlike other CSS
  properties, user agent property names are case-sensitive.
