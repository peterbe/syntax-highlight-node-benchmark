# Syntax Hightlight Node Benchmark

**See [this blog post](https://www.peterbe.com/plog/benchmark-compare-highlight.js-vs-prism)
for context.**

To test this you need a directory full of little `.txt` files scattered in
folders that are called things like `xml`, `html`, `js`, and `xml`.
E.g. `/tmp/syntax-code/css/fed42c7.txt`

As you run `node index.js` you might need to edit it and comment in and out
some of the code towards the bottom.
